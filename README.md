# Tamber API Client for Python

You can sign up for a Tamber account at https://tamber.com.

For full API documentation, refer to https://tamber.com/docs/api.

## Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade tamber
```

or

```sh
easy_install --upgrade tamber
```

See http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html for instructions
on installing pip. If you are on a system with easy_install but not
pip, you can use easy_install instead. If you're not using virtualenv,
you may have to prefix those commands with `sudo`. You can learn more
about virtualenv at http://www.virtualenv.org/


## Compatibility

We are compatible with Python 2.6+, Python 3.1+ and PyPy
